# MSBot Command Line tool

The MSBot tool is a command line tool to create and manage bot resources described via a .bot file. See [here](./docs/bot-file.md) to learn more about the .bot file. 

Bot Builder tools are designed to work together. Other Bot Builder tools like [LUIS CLI](../LUIS), [QnA Maker CLI](../QnAMaker), [Dispatch CLI](../Dispatch) and the [Bot Framework V4 Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) are designed to work with the .bot file and the MSBot CLI.

See [here](./docs/botframework-configuration.md) to learn about consuming the .bot file in your bots built with the [Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder). This will enable a seamless end-to-end creating, management and consumption of connected services your bot relies on.

See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) to learn more about Bot Framework Emulator V4. Emulator also relies on .bot file and provides rich UI based experience to connect and manage connected services your bot relies on.
